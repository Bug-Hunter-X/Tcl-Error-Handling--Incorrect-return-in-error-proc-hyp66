This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl error handling where the return value after an error is not properly managed.  The `myproc` procedure is designed to handle a negative input for `x` by calling `error_proc`, however, the return value after the error is not explicitly set. The solution shows how to use `error` command to stop execution correctly and `return` only after successful calculation.
